# Multi-user AI chat with RedwoodSDK RSC and Cloudflare agents

Three implementations of multi-user streaming AI chat -- deployed at https://agents-chat.jldec.workers.dev/.

1. [RSC Chat](https://agents-chat.jldec.workers.dev/chat-rsc) - sync via [RedwoodSDK realtime websockets](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/realtime/)
2. [Agent Chat](https://agents-chat.jldec.workers.dev/chat-agent) - sync via [Cloudflare Agents websockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/api-reference/websockets/)
3. [TinyBase Chat](https://agents-chat.jldec.workers.dev/chat-tinybase) - sync via [TinyBase websockets](https://tinybase.org/) 

## First impressions
- All three implementations rely on Cloudflare [durable objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/#what-are-durable-objects) with websockets. This is great for runtime performance and makes deployment easy. There are no containers to build or servers to manage.
- React is great for a use case like this where updates are coming from both the server and the client. All three implementations use the same [MessageList](src/app/shared/MessageList.tsx) component.

#### RedwoodSK realtime RSC
- Server components are a [succinct](https://github.com/jldec/agents-chat/blob/main/src/app/chat-rsc/ChatRSC.tsx) way to pre-populate JSX with data and then keep clients up to date.
- It's nice to be able to use async data loading inline on the server. Rendering with data from remote storage during streaming can be slower unless data is memoized.
- The scope of the RSC update payload sent to clients may become a problem during streaming, e.g. for pages with a lot of data. Discussion about this in the [rwsdk discord](https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1374715298636238968/1376288266789064734).
- Server functions are convenient, but should be used with care since they generate HTTP APIs which is where auth/authz is commonly required. See [this take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD-KK4hiULU) from Jack Herrington for more.

#### Cloudflare Agents websockets
- Using Cloudflare Agents websockets means that we have [full control](https://github.com/jldec/agents-chat/blob/main/src/app/chat-agent/WebsocketAgent.ts) over the payloads. This allows for nice optimizations e.g. to send partial data during streaming.
- Rendering chat history on the client via fetch or via websocket makes the initial UX a little janky. (TODO: investigate pre-rendering)
- Agents can combine both the chat storage and the websocket in one durable object. (TODO)

#### TinyBase sync
- Synchronization is happening between memory and persistance on every node, and between nodes.
- This improves the UX once data is persisted on the client and makes it easy to use React hooks listening for database updates.
- The APIs for [persistence and synchronization](https://github.com/jldec/agents-chat/blob/main/src/app/chat-tinybase/store.ts#L14-L38) feel like they could be consolidated.
- Since store operations run on the client we have to be extra careful with validation e.g. to deal with  clients being compromized.
- Localstorage persistence has an [issue](https://github.com/jldec/agents-chat/issues/13) with multiple tabs.

## Why?

I'm exploring how to build multi-user AI chat because I expect this to become the universal UI for humans and agents to work together.
The idea to try 3 architectures came from the same [rwsdk discord](https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1374715298636238968/1376269189802627112) thread.

> #### The must-have requirements are,
>
> 1. load up to one full page size of recent messages on client start,
> 2. live-stream new messages (e.g. AI responses) to all active clients.,
> 3. return older messages only when requested by a specific client.,
>
> ### Architectural choices:
>
> #### 1. custom JSON over websockets,
>
> Instead of using the rwsdk realtime feature, send messages (and message chunks when streaming) via JSON over websockets like cloudflare/agents. One way to build this would be with the useAgentChat react hook from the same library. Rendering happens client-side.
>
> #### 2. RSCs with rwsdk and realtime,
>
> Use rwsdk with server components for realtime updates to send the first page of messages and keep it updated as it changes. Call a separate api route (or server-function) to fetch earlier messages when needed. This solution will be more chatty (1 page of messages on the wire for each realtime update), but probably ok. There is also some complexity (I haven't tried yet) to blend RSCs with the earlier messages, but I think it's doable with some experimentation.
>
> #### 3. sync data,
>
> Use a generic sync engine like tinybase to sync state between the durable objects and browsers, and render messages on the client This has the benefit of built-in support for client-persistence (local caching) and also syncs just one value at a time (not the whole page like rwsdk), but it adds some complexity and some constraints to how things are represented on the server side.
